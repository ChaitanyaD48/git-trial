    <h1><b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h1>
    <p> There are 8 files(modules) present in the main package of this project.<br>

        <h4> A combination of all these modules makes the Voice Assistant work efficiently.<br>
       </b></h4>
       <hr>
       
      
       
      <h2><b> 1.VoiceAssistant_main.py</b><br></h2>
        
       
       <i>This is the main file that encapsulates the other 7 files. It is advisable to run this file to avail all the benefits of the Voice Assistant.
       After giving the command to run this file to your computer, you will have to say “Hello Python” to activate the voice assistant. After the activation, a menu will be displayed on the screen, showing all the tasks that Voice Assistant can do. This menu is displayed with the help of the print_menu()  function present in the menu.py module.</i></p>
       </p><i>Speaking out the respective commands of the desired task will indicate the Voice Assistant to do the following task. Once the speech is recorded, it will be converted to ` str ` by hear() or short_hear() function of the speakListen.py module. 
       For termination of the program after a task is complete, the command “close python” should be spoken. For abrupt termination of the program, for Windows and Linux – Ctrl + c key combination should be used.</p></i>

      <h2><b>2.speakListen.py</b></h2>
<b><u>This is the module that contains the following functions: -</u></b>
<p><i>1. speak(text) – This function speaks out the ‘text’ provided as a parameter. The 
text is a string(str). They say() and runAndWait() functions of Engine class in 
pyttsx3 enable the assistant to speak. Microsoft SAPI5 has provided the voice.</p>
<p>2. hear() – This function records the voice for 9 seconds using your microphone as 
source and converts speech to text using recognize_google(). 
recognize_google() performs speech recognition on ``audio_data`` (an 
``AudioData`` instance), using the Google Speech Recognition API.</p>
<p>3. long_hear(duration_time) – This function records voice for the ‘duration_time’ 
provided with 60 seconds as the default time. It too converts speech to text in a 
similar fashion to hear()</p>
<p>4. short_hear(duration_time) – This functions records voice similar to hear() but 
for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>5. greet(g) - Uses the datetime library to generate current time and then greets 
accordingly.</p></i>

<h2><b>3.websiteWork.py</b></h2>
    
<b><u>This module mainly handles the ‘searching on the web’ task of this project. It uses wikipedia 
and webbrowser libraries to aid its tasks. Following are the functions present in this module:-</b></u> 

<i><p>1. google_search() – Searches the sentence spoken by the user on the web and 
opens the google-searched results in the default browser.</p>
<P>2. wiki_search() - Searches the sentence spoken by the user on the web and opens 
the Wikipedia-searched results in the default browser. It also speaks out the 
summary of the result and asks the user whether he wants to open the website 
of the corresponding query.</P></i>

<h2><b>4.textRead.py</h2></b>
<b><u>This module is mainly related to file processing and converting text to speech. Following are 
the functions present in this module: -</u></b>
<i><p>1. ms_word – Read out the TEXT in MS Word (.docx) file provided in the location.</p>
<p>2. pdf_read – Can be used to read pdf files and more specifically eBooks. It has
basically 3 options:-</p> 
<p>a. Read a single page <br>
b. Read a range of pages <br>
c. Read a lesson <br>
d. Read the whole book<br></p>
<p>It can also print the index and can find out the author’s name, the title, and 
the total number of pages in the PDF file.</p>
<p>3. doubleslash(location) – Mainly intended to help Windows users, if the user 
copies the default path which contains 1 ‘/ ’; the program doubles it so it is not 
considered as an escape sequence.</p>
<p>4. print_index(toc) - Prints out the index in proper format with the title name and 
page number. It takes ‘toc’ as a parameter which is a nested list with toc[i][1] -
Topic name and toc[i][2] – with page number.</p>
<p>5. print_n_speak_index(toc) - It is similar to print_index() but here it also speaks 
out the index.</p>
<p>6. book_details(author, title, total_pages) - Creates a table of book details like 
author name, title, and total pages. It uses table and console from rich library.</i></p>

<h2><b>5.dictator.py</b></h2>

<i><p><u>This module is like the dictator function and dictates the text that we speak. So basically, it 
converts the speech that we speak to text. The big_text(duration_time) function 
encapsulates the long_hear() function. So by default, it records for 60 seconds but it can 
record for any amount of time as specified by the user.</i></u></p>

<h2><b>6.menu.py</b></h2>
<i><u><p>It prints out the menu which contains the tasks and it corresponding commands. Rich library 
is being used here</u></i></p>
